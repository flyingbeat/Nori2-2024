Some troubleshooting for building:

## 1. Compilation problems in Linux

If you are using the GCC compiler (g++) version 13 (you can check with the command "g++ -v"), chances are the code will not compile because of compatiblity issues. There are several possible solutions

### Solution 1: downgrade to g++12 (easy)

You can downgrade to g++-12:

`sudo apt install g++-12`

And then tell cmake that it should use g++-12 instead:

`cmake -DCMAKE_CXX-COMPILER=/usr/bin/g++-12 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..`

From now on, you only have to be in the build directory and run `make -j 4` to recompile.

If g++ is not installed in that path, you can find it with:

`whereis g++-12`

### Solution 2: use clang instead (easy)

You can use clang instead of g++, which is usually slightly faster at compiling.

Install the libraries:

`sudo apt install -y clang libc++-dev libc++abi-dev cmake ninja-build`

Set clang as the compiler:

`export CC=clang export CXX=clang++`

Create the build files, and compile:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
ninja
```

From now on, you only have to be in the build directory and run `ninja` to recompile.

### Solution 3: Fix the g++13 issue (maybe harder)

You have to modify one line in one file of the _tbb_ library. See [here](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/cmdstan-installation-fails-on-linux-issue-with-tbb/31125/2) for more details.

## 2. Compiling in Windows without cmake-gui

First, you need cmake and the Visual Studio compiler (_not_ Visual Studio Code) so that you can generate the build files:

```
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -B build
```

Then, to compile:

```
cmake --build build --config Release -j 10
```

(you can use `-j 10` to compile with 10 threads, etc.)

You can sometimes use --config Debug to enable debug mode. Be careful with this, the renders will be ~10 times slower.
