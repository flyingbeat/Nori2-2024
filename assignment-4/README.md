## Features in the Interesting Scene

- The Camera and Viewport were adjusted such that the frame shows a wider FOV of 30 degrees and extends the frame to expose what is going on behind the main subjects
- because the scene is larger I increased the radiance of the lightning by a factor of 2.5 compared to other scenes we have seen
- The floor features a black and white chess texture
- I added chess pieces that feature a rough conductor metallic like appearance with different R0 and alpha values
- The scene also features two spheres one glass and one mirror like that add interesting effects to the scene, like the distorted image of the queen piece in the glass sphere
- I used the path_mis integrator to render the scene
